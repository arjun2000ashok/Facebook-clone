# Facebook-clone


This project was done by me to demonstrate the primary usage of data structures like graphs, linked lists, stacks and queues to implement a clone of the facebook network.

C++ has been used as the programming language.

The many options offered in facebook such as posting, sending friend request etc. have been implemented atop a graph data structure in the code.  

As the main purpose of the project is to understand the usage of the data structures, no database has been used. instead file streams have been used to retrieve the users in the system.

For scalability, TRIE structure was implemented to store the names of the users for easy searching when the number of users grows, but there were errors in the output when the trie structure was implemented, so the corresponding code is present in the program, but has not been used. 

The code is well-commented, so there should be no problem understand the use of various functions.
Pull requests are welcome!
